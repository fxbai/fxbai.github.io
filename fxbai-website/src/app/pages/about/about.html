    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Franklin, a computer science student at McMaster University. I’m a software developer who enjoys creating lightweight, clean, modern
      applications and solving challenging problems. I’ve worked with Angular framework,
      TypeScript, Java, and more extensively across personal, academic, hackathon, and co-op
      projects, seen here on my <a routerLink="/projects">Projects</a> page.

      In my free time, I enjoy longboarding, photography, cubing, and working on plastic model kits! Check out my 
        <a routerLink="/hobbies">Hobbies</a> page to see more if you're curious!
